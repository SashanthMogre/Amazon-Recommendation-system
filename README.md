# Amazon-Recommendation-system

## Problem Statement:

Everyday a million products are being recommended to users based on popularity and other metrics on e-commerce websites. The most popular e-commerce website boosts average order value by 50%, increases revenues by 300%, and improves conversion. In addition to being a powerful tool for increasing revenues, product recommendations are so essential that customers now expect to see similar features on all other e-commerce sites. Amazon is referred to as "one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world", as well as the world's most valuable brand. Our objective is to make a recommendation system that recommends new products based on userâ€™s habits.
